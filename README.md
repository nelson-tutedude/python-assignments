# Tutedude Python Assignments

This repository tracks my progress through the Tutedude Python certification course. It serves as a centralized collection of my solutions to the 14 core assignments included in the curriculum.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into sequential directories. Each folder contains the specific tasks and code solutions for that unit of the course.

* **`assignment-01`** through **`assignment-14`**
* Each directory includes documented `.py` files corresponding to individual tasks.

## Course Overview

The Tutedude curriculum transitions from fundamental syntax to specialized applications. The modules covered include:

* **Foundations:** Basic concepts, control structures (loops/conditionals), and core data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples).
* **Core Programming:** Function design, modules, exception handling, and file I/O.
* **Advanced Logic:** Functional programming (lambdas, maps, filters), regular expressions, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
* **GUI & Databases:** Desktop app development with **Tkinter** and database management using **PostgreSQL**.
* **Data Science:** Comprehensive data analysis using **Anaconda**, **Pandas**, and regression modeling.
* **Web Development:** Full-stack development using both the **Django** and **Flask** frameworks.
* **Automation & Specializations:** Web crawling, automation with **Selenium**, network programming (Socket chat apps), and image processing with **OpenCV**.

## How to Use This Repo
